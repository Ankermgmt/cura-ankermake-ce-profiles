## Overview

This repository holds the latest version and updates to AnkerMake community profiles [initially developed and maintained by @just-trey](https://github.com/just-trey/ankermake-m5-profile). We have decided to continue to support these profiles to allow users an alternative to the official profiles provided by AnkerMake. You can install these profiles alongside the built-in AnkerMake profiles. Why not install both and see which one you prefer?

## Known Issues

- Printed speed will report and warn higher than 5x because of how Cura calculates speed. There are no significant quality or other impacts on the actual print.

## Note

The configuration authors strongly believe there is no "one size fits all" profile. These profiles provide an excellent base to get started, but we highly encourage users to learn and adjust their slicer settings to suit their use case.

## Installing the profile

These profiles will allow you to add the AnkerMake M5 CE as a new printer in the menus.
Installing the profile:

1. Open Cura
1. Under the Help Menu, choose "Show Configuration Folder" (keep this folder open for the next several steps).
1. Close out of Cura
1. Download [Cura-AMCE-Profile.zip](https://github.com/Ankermgmt/cura-ankermake-ce-profiles/releases/latest/download/Cura-AMCE-Profile.zip)
1. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice and open the folder.
1. Copy the Contents of this folder to the Configuration folder you opened in step two. (Note you will be adding files to the directories)
1. Open Cura, and you should now be able to add a new AnkerMake M5 Printer.

Optional: Enter a new Printer Name
Complete the printer setup
You now should have an AnkerMake M5 CE printer setup with some basic built-in Printer Profiles.
